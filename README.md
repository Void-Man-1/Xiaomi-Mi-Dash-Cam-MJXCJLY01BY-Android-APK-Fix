# Simple overview

## What is this?

This repository provides an unofficial compatibility version of the European Mi Dash Cam app for the Xiaomi Mi Dash Cam `MJXCJLY01BY`. It is intended specifically for this camera model and the European app variant.

Version 2.0.0 works locally without a Mi account and restores the phone features needed to set up and use the dashcam.

The app has been checked on real phones running Android 8.1, 9, 12, and 16, with additional Android 13–15 testing described below. The exact release-signed 2.0.0 APK completed a full physical test on a Poco F6 running Android 16 / HyperOS 3. Camera connection and reconnection, live preview, the recording grid and thumbnails, completed downloads, and recording replay all worked.

This project provides the release APK through GitHub Releases together with its explanation, screenshots, checksums, and test results. Developers can review, reproduce, and improve the compatibility work through the [patch source kit](source-kit/README.md) without redistributing the complete decompiled Xiaomi/70mai application. The tested APK is available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Void-Man-1/Mi-Dash-cam-Android-8.1-16-fix-MJXCJLY01BY/releases/latest).

The patched app provides:

- connect to the dashcam over Wi-Fi;
- see the live camera view;
- browse recordings and thumbnails;
- download recordings to the phone;
- replay downloaded videos;
- change camera settings;
- read help and user manuals without relying on dead websites.

## Common problems this fixes

This project is intended for owners of the **Xiaomi Mi Dash Cam `MJXCJLY01BY` European/EU model** whose original Mi Dash Cam app no longer works correctly on a newer Android phone. It addresses the common symptoms people encounter when trying to keep this camera usable:

- **Mi Dash Cam APK will not install on Android 15 or Android 16** because the original app targets an obsolete Android API level;
- **Mi Dash Cam connects to Wi-Fi but the app does not connect correctly** to the camera;
- **black or missing live preview** after connecting to the dashcam;
- crashes or freezes when opening camera, profile, help, manual, or settings screens;
- recordings or thumbnails not loading correctly, or downloaded recordings not replaying as expected;
- obsolete **Mi account / Xiaomi login** dependencies blocking normal local use;
- compatibility problems on modern **ARM64**, **16 KiB page-size**, **HyperOS**, and Android devices.

The final 2.0.0 release was hardware-tested with the European `MJXCJLY01BY` on a **Poco F6 running Android 16 / HyperOS 3**, including connection and reconnection, live preview, recording thumbnails, download, and playback. It is not a compatibility claim for the similarly named Mi Dash Cam 1S (`MJXCJLY02BY`).

For symptom-by-symptom diagnosis, see the dedicated [Mi Dash Cam MJXCJLY01BY troubleshooting guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Why I made it

This project exists because I wanted to use my dashcam, only to discover that its original app no longer worked on my phone. The newer Mi Home app did not want to connect to this dashcam either. The camera was still functional, but the software needed to use it had effectively been left behind.

The original Mi Dash Cam app would crash when opening its buttons, hang while connected, show a black live preview, display obsolete update messages, and send its help buttons to `502 Bad Gateway` pages. On Android 15 and newer, the untouched APK was also too old to install normally.

Rather than discard working hardware because its companion app was abandoned, the app was taken apart, studied, repaired, rebuilt, signed, and tested on current devices.

## Abandonment timeline

No formal Xiaomi/70mai announcement declaring the app abandoned was found, so this timeline separates verifiable records from the point where the app became practically unusable.

| Date | What happened |
|---|---|
| January 2018 | Third-party app history records show the European Mi Dash Cam app appearing on Google Play. |
| 23 May 2018 | Original version 1.1.0 was published. It targeted Android 6 / API 23 and contained only 32-bit ARM libraries. This is the last verifiable original release. ([APKMirror record](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/70mai-co-ltd/mi-dash-cam-2/mi-dash-cam-2-1-1-0-release/mi-dash-cam-1-1-0-android-apk-download/)) |
| 2018–2024 | No newer original European APK was found. Android, phone CPUs, media libraries, storage rules, and security requirements continued moving forward while the app remained at 1.1.0. |
| 18 September 2024 | AppBrain records the app as removed from Google Play and still lists 1.1.0 as its final version. ([AppBrain history](https://www.appbrain.com/app/mi-dash-cam/com.banyac.mijia.app.eu)) |
| Android 15 era | Android began rejecting normal installation of apps targeting below API 24. The original targets API 23, so fresh installation fails on Android 15/16. ([Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-all)) |
| 28 August 2026 | This investigation reproduced the crashes, freezing, black preview, dead update flow, and HTTP 502 help pages. The current Mi Home app also failed to provide a working replacement connection for this EU camera. |
| 1 September 2026 | The new generation became `2.0.0`. It removes the remaining executable Mi-account/login code and adds targeted hardening for a reported hang when connecting to the camera again. |
| 2 September 2026 | The exact release-signed 2.0.0 APK completed full physical-camera acceptance on a Poco F6 running Android 16 / HyperOS 3. Connection, reconnection, live preview, recordings, thumbnails, download, and replay passed. |

The important point is simple: the hardware outlived its software support by years.

## Original app archive references

These links preserve the abandoned European app's public history around the time it stopped being distributed through Google Play. They refer to Xiaomi/70mai's old stock package `com.banyac.mijia.app.eu`, not to this patched release:

- [APKMirror — Mi Dash Cam 1.1.0 (26), uploaded 23 May 2018](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/70mai-co-ltd/mi-dash-cam-2/mi-dash-cam-2-1-1-0-release/mi-dash-cam-1-1-0-android-apk-download/)
- [APKCombo — Mi Dash Cam package archive, versions 1.0.1 through 1.1.0](https://apkcombo.com/mi-dash-cam/com.banyac.mijia.app.eu/)
- [APKFab — Mi Dash Cam package archive with 1.0.1, 1.0.2, and 1.1.0](https://apkfab.com/mi-dash-cam/com.banyac.mijia.app.eu)
- [AppBrain — Google Play history and removal record](https://www.appbrain.com/app/mi-dash-cam/com.banyac.mijia.app.eu)

The mirror metadata agrees on final stock version 1.1.0, 32-bit `armeabi-v7a`, and package name `com.banyac.mijia.app.eu`. APKMirror records the original file SHA-256 as `3AC4C02EF5D43A0F9636637B1359073818C6799F3BFE3A7E2A38633F653D95A8`. These old files are kept here as historical references only; they do not contain the Android 12–16 compatibility fixes. Use this repository's Releases page for the patched APK.

## What was fixed?

In plain language:

- It installs again: The app is accepted by Android 15 and 16 without special installation commands.
- The menus work: Add camera, Profile, Tips, Installation, User manual, FAQ, and settings no longer crash the app.
- The camera connects: Direct Wi-Fi communication with `MJXCJLY01BY` is preserved.
- Live preview works: The app now uses the network transport expected by the camera instead of leaving a black video area.
- The app stays responsive: The repeated media-player restart loop was removed, and VideoLAN's upstream asynchronous native-stop fix was backported so a dead RTSP session cannot hold Android's main thread during teardown.
- Connecting again works: Version 2.0.0 cancels stale camera-screen requests and removes long hidden retries from the fast control commands used during connection. Physical connection and reconnection testing passed on the Poco F6.
- Recordings work: File lists, thumbnails, download, and replay are operational.
- No Mi account is required: The app starts as `Offline account` and uses the camera locally.
- The help section works offline: Dead 502 web pages were replaced with built-in help and four clearly named PDF manuals.
- The obsolete app-update prompt is gone: It cannot keep asking for an update that will never arrive.
- The camera firmware button was left alone: It remains a separate original function.
- Modern phone CPUs are supported: ARM64 and 16 KiB-page compatibility were added while retaining older ARMv7 support.

## Supported Android versions

| Android | Status | Verified on |
|---|---|---|
| Android 8.1 | Exact 2.0.0 clean install and physical app/UI regression verified; camera hardware not tested | FUJITSU F-01L, API 27 |
| Android 9 | Exact 2.0.0 clean install and physical app/UI regression verified; camera hardware not tested | SHARP AQUOS sense2 (`SH-01L`), API 28 |
| Android 10–11 | Not tested | No support claim yet |
| Android 12 | Exact 2.0.0 clean install and physical app/UI verified; final camera acceptance was conducted on Android 16 | Samsung Galaxy Note10+ (`SM-N975F`), One UI 4.1 |
| Android 13 | App/UI verified in an emulator during development; physical device and camera network not tested | BlueStacks 5 Android 13 Beta, API 33 (`Tiramisu64`) |
| Android 14 | Physical app/UI regression verified during development; remotely hosted phones could not reach the camera network | Samsung Galaxy S24 (`SM-S921U`) and S24 Ultra (`SM-S928U1`), API 34 |
| Android 15 | 2.0.0 debug-build replacement and clean-data smoke verified; release-signed APK and camera network not tested | MuMu Player, API 35 |
| Android 16 | Exact 2.0.0 clean install and physical app/UI verified; not the final camera-test device | Redmi 13C (`24040RN64Y`), HyperOS `3.0.4.0.WNTEUXM` |
| Android 16 | Exact release-signed 2.0.0 fully hardware accepted with the EU camera | Poco F6, HyperOS `3.0.303.0.WNPEUXM.C07` |

A complete physical test was conducted with the exact release-signed 2.0.0 APK and the EU `MJXCJLY01BY` connected to the Poco F6. Startup, camera connection and reconnection, visible live preview, sustained responsiveness, the recording grid and thumbnails, completed downloads, and recording replay all passed. The [privacy-redacted recording of the acceptance test](assets/evidence/poco-f6-android16-v2.0.0-full-camera-test.mp4) is included in the repository.

On BlueStacks Android 13, a development build installed with its ARM64 libraries, cold-launched, showed the tokenless profile, rendered offline Tips/manuals, and opened Add camera with no fatal exception or ANR. BlueStacks' virtual networking was not used as a substitute for a physical camera-Wi-Fi test.

On two physical Android Device Streaming phones running Samsung Android 14/API 34, a development build clean-installed as ARM64, cold-launched, showed `Offline account` / `No Mi account connected`, rendered all four local help/manual sections, handed a bundled PDF to Android's resolver, and opened the Add-camera hotspot guide. Android exit history and event logs contained no crash or ANR. Because these phones are hosted remotely in Google's device lab, they cannot join the dashcam's local Wi-Fi and do not replace the Poco F6 camera/live-preview acceptance test.

The exact release-signed 2.0.0 APK was clean-installed on a physical FUJITSU F-01L running Android 8.1/API 27 and a physical SHARP AQUOS sense2 SH-01L running Android 9/API 28 through Android Device Streaming. Both selected the bundled `arm64-v8a` libraries and passed the main screen, `Offline account`, Add camera, Tips, Installation, User manual, FAQ, all four bundled manual entries, and two additional cold relaunches. Android 8.1 rendered the selected PDF; Android 9 handed it to Android and displayed the PDF application chooser. Captured diagnostics contained no app crash, ANR, or Xiaomi-account authentication signal.

Those remotely hosted phones cannot join the `MJXCJLY01BY` local Wi-Fi. They did not test camera connection, live preview, recording access, download, or replay and are not camera-hardware acceptance tests.

## Download and install

Download the exact release-signed `Mi-Dash-Cam-EU-2.0.0-android12-16-arm64.apk` from the repository's [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Void-Man-1/Mi-Dash-cam-Android-8.1-16-fix-MJXCJLY01BY/releases/latest). Do not install an unsigned, debug, or differently signed build presented under the same version.

1. Download the exact 2.0.0 APK from GitHub Releases.
2. Verify its SHA-256 against [`checksums/SHA256SUMS.txt`](checksums/SHA256SUMS.txt).
3. Save anything you need, then uninstall any existing Mi Dash Cam app, whether it is Xiaomi's stock app or a community 1.1.x build. Version 2.0.0 uses a new release signing key, so Android cannot install it over either signing lineage. Uninstalling clears the existing app's local data.
4. Open the downloaded APK and allow installation from that browser or file-manager source when Android asks.
5. Launch Mi Dash Cam. It should open directly as `Offline account`, without Mi-account login.
6. Power on the `MJXCJLY01BY`, join its Wi-Fi network, and add/connect it in the app. The camera network intentionally has no internet; tell Android to stay connected if it warns or tries to switch back to mobile data/another Wi-Fi network.

Version 2.0.0 begins a new signing lineage. It cannot upgrade Xiaomi's stock app or earlier community 1.1.x builds in place. Every future 2.0.0+ release must use the same new release key so upgrades within the new lineage remain possible.

## Common problems and FAQ

### Does Xiaomi Mi Dash Cam MJXCJLY01BY work on Android 16?

Yes, with this compatibility release. The exact release-signed 2.0.0 APK was fully tested with a European `MJXCJLY01BY` camera on a Poco F6 running Android 16 / HyperOS 3. Camera connection and reconnection, live preview, recording thumbnails, downloads, and playback passed the physical acceptance test.

### Where can I download a working Mi Dash Cam APK?

Use the **Download Latest APK** button at the top of this README. It links directly to the canonical signed APK attached to the latest supported GitHub release. For release identity and integrity information, verify the SHA-256 listed in `checksums/SHA256SUMS.txt`.

### Why will the original Mi Dash Cam APK not install on Android 15 or Android 16?

The final original European Mi Dash Cam app targets Android API 23. Android 15 introduced a minimum installable target SDK requirement that rejects apps targeting below API 24 during normal installation. This project raises the target while preserving the legacy camera functionality needed by `MJXCJLY01BY`.

### Why does Mi Dash Cam show a black live preview?

The legacy application and modern Android/network stacks do not always negotiate the camera's old RTSP/RTP-JPEG stream correctly. This release repairs the live-preview path and uses RTSP over TCP, which was verified during the physical camera test.

### Does the patched app require a Mi account or Xiaomi login?

No. Version 2.0.0 starts with an `Offline account` and is designed for local phone-to-camera use. The obsolete executable Mi-account login implementation was removed from the production build.

### Does this work on Poco F6 and HyperOS?

Yes. The final signed 2.0.0 release passed the complete physical-camera acceptance test on a Poco F6 running Android 16 / HyperOS 3. Other tested Android versions and the exact scope of each test are listed in the compatibility table above.

### Is MJXCJLY01BY the same camera as Mi Dash Cam 1S / MJXCJLY02BY?

No. `MJXCJLY01BY` is the supported European Mi Dash Cam model for this project. `MJXCJLY02BY` is the similarly named Mi Dash Cam 1S and is not claimed compatible.

### Will this fix every Xiaomi or 70mai dashcam?

No. This project deliberately targets the European Xiaomi Mi Dash Cam `MJXCJLY01BY`. It should not be treated as a universal Xiaomi, Mijia, or 70mai camera application.

# Technical details

## Exact camera identification

| Property | Supported value |
|---|---|
| Product name | Xiaomi Mi Dash Cam |
| Model number | `MJXCJLY01BY` |
| Region | European / EU app and camera variant |
| Android package | `com.banyac.mijia.app.eu` |
| Video | 1920 × 1080 |
| Wi-Fi | 802.11 b/g/n, direct phone-to-camera connection |

The model number and hardware specifications are corroborated by Xiaomi's [official Mi Dash Cam specification page](https://www.mi.com/mj-carcorder/specs) and [global compliance index](https://www.mi.com/global/support/terms/declaration/). The compliance index separately identifies `MJXCJLY02BY` as Mi Dash Cam 1S.

## Detailed changes

### Added or repaired

| Area | Technical change |
|---|---|
| Android installation | Raised `targetSdkVersion` from 23 to 28, clearing Android 15's minimum installable target floor. |
| CPU compatibility | Added `arm64-v8a` IJK and VLC libraries while retaining `armeabi-v7a`. |
| 16 KiB systems | Aligned every ARM64 ELF `PT_LOAD` segment to `0x10000` and verified APK packaging with `zipalign -P 16`. |
| Legacy HTTP | Declared optional `org.apache.http.legacy`, fixing the `AndroidHttpClient` navigation crash introduced by the API-28 target. |
| Camera network | Preserved cleartext local HTTP for camera CGI, thumbnail, download, and media endpoints. |
| Live preview | Added VLC `--rtsp-tcp` so the camera's RTP/JPEG stream is interleaved over RTSP TCP. |
| Responsiveness | Removed the five-second UI-thread VLC stop/recreate cycle, limited failure handling, added lifecycle cleanup, and backported VideoLAN's asynchronous `nativeStop()` fix for modules that can hang during teardown. |
| Recurrent connection | Before a new camera-screen initialization, cancels stale tagged requests; fast control requests use a 4-second timeout and no hidden retry. Recording-list and media-download timing is unchanged. |
| Download handling | Replaced an exposed `file://` media-scan broadcast with `MediaScannerConnection.scanFile()`. |
| Help content | Replaced dead 70mai web routes with responsive offline Tips, Installation, FAQ, Wi-Fi help, and a manual library. |
| Manuals | Bundled English phone-friendly, English landscape, Russian phone-friendly, and Russian original landscape PDFs. |
| Accountless use | Uses a tokenless local profile named `Offline account`; fresh installs skip Mi-account sign-in. Version 2.0.0 also removes the old login activity, Xiaomi account SDK bytecode, auth-service interfaces, and remote-profile client/callback. |
| Defensive account cleanup | Retains code that erases Mi access tokens and avatar URLs if encountered during a later same-key 2.x migration. Moving from stock or community 1.1.x to 2.0.0 still requires an uninstall, so older app data is not carried into this signing lineage. |
| UI identity | Displays `Patched by Void__Man` and `Version: 2.0.0` above the unchanged firmware row. |

Android's relevant platform documentation is available for the [Android 15 install restriction](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-all), [Apache HTTP compatibility](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-changes-28), [Android 16 compatibility testing](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/migration), and [16 KiB page sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes).

### Removed or disabled

- Xiaomi OAuth permission, authorization/login activities, OAuth app ID, and redirect metadata from the production manifest.
- The executable Xiaomi account SDK, auth-service interfaces, and remote-profile client/callback used by the old login flow.
- Both obsolete application self-update prompts.
- Broken `eu-help.70mai.com` navigation that returned HTTP 502.
- The blocking five-second live-preview retry loop.
- Unsafe `file://` media notification behavior.
- Display or remote reuse of a historical Mi-account identifier during normal operation.

Some inert inherited resource identifiers can still contain old login-related names, but current executable-code scans find no Xiaomi account endpoint, account SDK class, auth-service interface, login activity, access-token starter, OAuth authorizer, or OAuth app-ID reference.

### Deliberately preserved

- Original local CGI, recording-list, thumbnail, download, replay, settings, and streaming protocols.
- The separate clickable Firmware update row and its camera-firmware command path.
- European package identity and local device/database compatibility.
- ARMv7 support for older compatible phones.

The firmware button was not repurposed. The legacy OTA result is not guaranteed because Xiaomi/70mai controls that external backend.

## Offline-account behavior

- A clean installation creates only a local profile.
- The visible account name is `Offline account` with `No Mi account connected`.
- Legacy migration code clears stored Mi tokens and avatar URLs when it encounters them, but installing 2.0.0 requires removing any stock or community 1.1.x installation first, so that older app data is not carried into 2.0.0.
- The old internal identifier can remain only as a local database key for data created within the new 2.0.0+ signing lineage.
- Five reachable legacy request builders overwrite any field named `xiaomiId` with the anonymous string `offline-local`.
- A captured fresh compatibility-build launch/account/device/settings session produced no Mi/Xiaomi account DNS request and no cleartext authorization, cookie, token, or user-ID value. The exact 2.0.0 executable additionally has no reachable Mi-account implementation.

The app is accountless, not network-air-gapped. Camera control requires direct local network traffic, and inherited non-account configuration code can still resolve a 70mai service such as `de-api.70mai.com`.

## Verification

The exact release-signed 2.0.0 APK passed:

- APK Signature Scheme v1, v2, and v3 verification;
- `zipalign -P 16 -c 4`;
- AArch64/16 KiB ELF checks for all seven ARM64 native libraries;
- post-sign manifest, DEX, asset, and bundled-manual hash audits;
- exact clean-install app/UI tests on physical Android 8.1, 9, 12, and 16 phones, with additional development-build coverage on Android 13, 14, and 15;
- full real-camera operation on Poco F6 / HyperOS 3 / Android 16;
- physical connection and reconnection, recording-grid, thumbnail, completed-download, and replay checks;
- visible RTSP/RTP-JPEG live preview without the old repeated UI freeze;
- executable account-path and sensitive-data scans that found no reachable Mi-account implementation or embedded private credential;
- structural reconnect-policy checks and confirmation of the asynchronous VLC stop backport.

Static verification also covered a clean signed-APK decode and unsigned rebuild, exact `20000` / `2.0.0` identity checks, all four bundled manual hashes, and removal of the legacy login implementation. Clean installs on physical Android 8.1, 9, 12, and 16 phones reached the main screen, Offline account, Add camera, every local help/manual route, and bundled PDF handoff with zero captured fatal exceptions or ANRs. The Android 8.1 and Android 9 phones also passed two additional cold relaunches and produced zero captured Xiaomi-authentication signals. Android 15 MuMu debug-build replacement and clean-data smoke tests also passed; that same-debug-key replacement does not establish upgrade compatibility with Xiaomi's stock app or community 1.1.x builds.

The Poco F6 acceptance recording documents the final real-camera result. See the [2.0.0 verification report](docs/TEST_REPORT_2.0.0.md) and [recorded physical test](assets/evidence/poco-f6-android16-v2.0.0-full-camera-test.mp4).

The new key must be retained securely and used for every future 2.0.0+ release. Changing it again would require another uninstall and would clear app data again.

## Known limitations

- Only the Xiaomi Mi Dash Cam `MJXCJLY01BY` EU variant is supported. Mi Dash Cam 1S `MJXCJLY02BY` and other 70mai/Xiaomi cameras are not claimed compatible.
- Android 10 and 11 are untested. Android 13 is emulator-verified but has not received a physical-device/camera-network pass.
- Android 8.1, 9, and 14 have physical-device app/UI passes, but their remotely hosted phones could not access the local dashcam Wi-Fi. Camera behavior on those Android versions remains unverified.
- The preserved firmware-update backend may no longer be available.
- This is a compatibility patch around a legacy application, not a modern rewrite or a Google Play submission.
